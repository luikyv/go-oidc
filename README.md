## Get Started
To start using the `go-oidc` module in your project, install it with
```
go get github.com/luikyv/go-oidc@latest
```

Once installed, you can instantiate an openid provider and run it as shown below.
```go
key, _ := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
jwks := goidc.JSONWebKeySet{
  Keys: []goidc.JSONWebKey{{
    KeyID:     "key_id",
    Key:       key,
    Algorithm: "RS256",
  }},
}

op, _ := provider.New(
  goidc.ProfileOpenID,
  "http://localhost",
  func(_ context.Context) (goidc.JSONWebKeySet, error) {
    return jwks, nil
  },
)
_ = op.Run(":80")
```

You can then check the default configurations by accessing http://localhost/.well-known/openid-configuration.

## Documentation

### Running the Provider

After instantiating a new provider, the simplest way to run it is
```go
op.Run(":80")
```
For more flexibility, the provider can create an HTTP handler with all endpoints configured.
The example below demonstrates running the provider under TLS:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.Handle("/", op.Handler())

server := &http.Server{
	Addr:    ":443",
	Handler: mux,
}
_ := server.ListenAndServeTLS(certFilePath, certKeyFilePath)
```

### Storage
go-oidc revolves around three entities: `goidc.Client`, `goidc.AuthnSession` and `goidc.GrantSession`.

These entities are managed by implementations of `goidc.ClientManager`, `goidc.AuthnSessionManager` and `goidc.GrantSessionManager` respectively.

By default, `provider.Provider` uses an in-memory implementation of these interfaces, meaning all stored entities are lost when the server shuts down.

It is highly recommended to replace the default storage with custom implementations to ensure persistence.
For more details, see `provider.WithClientStorage`, `provider.WithAuthnSessionStorage` and `provider.WithGrantSessionStorage`.

#### Client
`goidc.Client` is the entity that interacts with the authorization server to request tokens and access protected resources.

It is always identified and queried by its ID.

#### Authentication Session
`goidc.AuthnSession` is a short-lived session that stores information about authorization requests.

It enables more advanced authentication flows by allowing interactions during the authentication process.

At any given time, `goidc.AuthnSession` will always have an ID and exactly one of the following identifiers, which serve as indexes for lookup operations:
- Pushed Authorization Request ID – Created when the client submits a `POST /par` request. See [RFC 9126](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9126.html).
- Callback ID – Used when the authentication policy is still in progress.
- Authorization Code – Set for the `authorization_code` grant type and when the authentication policy completes successfully, allowing the client to exchange it for a token.
- Authentication Request ID – Used for Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication. See [CIBA](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0-final.html).

#### Grant Session
`goidc.GrantSession` represents the access granted to a client by an entity, which can be either a user or the client itself.

It holds information about the token issued and the entity who granted access.

At any given time, `goidc.GrantSession` will always have an ID and a token ID for the currently active token. Additionally, it may contain the following identifiers, which serve as indexes for lookup and deletion operations:
- Refresh Token ID - Present when the grant allows issuing a refresh token. This is a hashed representation of the token, ensuring the raw value is never stored.
- Authorization Code - Set when using the authorization_code grant type.

After each refresh token request, the token ID is updated. The refresh token id is updated only if refresh token rotation is enabled.

### Authentication Policies

For authorization requests (when grant types such as implicit and authorization_code are enabled) which start by default at `/authorize`, users are authenticated with an available `goidc.AuthnPolicy`.

The policy manages user interactions and modifies the `goidc.AuthnSession` to determine how access and ID tokens are issued, including the information they contain. Refer to the fields of `goidc.AuthnSession` for details on what can be modified and how.

The policy below includes a setup function that always returns `true`, meaning the authentication function will execute for all requests.
If the setup function were to return `false`, the authentication function would not be evaluated.

The authentication function renders an HTML page to collect the username and returns `goidc.StatusInProgress`, pausing the flow while awaiting user interaction.

Authentication resumes when a request is made to `/authorize/{callback_id}`.
For example, the HTML page could submit a form via `POST /authorize/{callback_id}` to continue the authentication process.

The **callback ID** is pre-populated in the authentication session and can be accessed via `goidc.AuthnSession.CallbackID`.
Once the user is identified, the authentication process completes successfully by returning `goidc.StatusSuccess`.

If the authentication function returns either `goidc.StatusFailure` or an error, the flow is stopped, and the grant is denied.
```go
policy := goidc.NewPolicy(
  "main_policy",
  // Setup function.
  func(_ *http.Request, _ *goidc.Client, _ *goidc.AuthnSession) bool {
    return true
  },
  // Authentication function.
  func(r http.ResponseWriter, w *http.Request, as *goidc.AuthnSession) (AuthnStatus, error) {
    username := r.PostFormValue("username")
    if username == "" {
      renderHTMLPage(w)
      return goidc.StatusInProgress, nil
    }

    if username == "banned_user" {
      return goidc.StatusFailure, errors.New("the user is banned")
    }

    as.Subject = username
    return goidc.StatusSuccess, nil
  },
)

op, err := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithAuthorizationCodeGrant(),
  provider.WithPolicy(policy),
  ...,
)
```

For a more complex example of a `goidc.AuthnPolicy`, check out the examples folder.

### Signing and Encryption

When instantiating a new `provider.Provider`, a JWKS function must be informed. This function returns the keys that will be used as the authorization server's JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) for signing and encryption. Typically, it should return both private and public key material.

The algorithms configured for the provider must have a corresponding JWK in the JWKS. Otherwise, an error will occur.

```go
key, _ := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
// JWKS with private and public information.
jwks := goidc.JSONWebKeySet{
  Keys: []goidc.JSONWebKey{{
    KeyID:     "key_id",
    Key:       key,
    Algorithm: "RS256",
  }},
}

op, _ := provider.New(
  goidc.ProfileOpenID,
  "http://localhost",
  // JWKS function.
  func(_ context.Context) (goidc.JSONWebKeySet, error) {
    return jwks, nil
  },
)
```

If direct access to private keys is unavailable for the provider or granular control over signing is required, the JWKS function can be configured to return only public key material. In such cases, the `provider.WithSignerFunc` option must be added to handle signing operations.
```go
key, _ := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
// JWKS with public information only.
jwks := goidc.JSONWebKeySet{
  Keys: []goidc.JSONWebKey{{
    KeyID:     "key_id",
    Key:       key.Public(),
    Algorithm: "RS256",
  }},
}

op, _ := provider.New(
  goidc.ProfileOpenID,
  "http://localhost",
  // JWKS function.
  func(_ context.Context) (goidc.JSONWebKeySet, error) {
    return jwks, nil
  },
  provider.WithSignerFunc(func(_ context.Context, _ goidc.SignatureAlgorithm) (kid string, signer crypto.Signer, err error) {
    return "key_id", key, nil
  }),
)
```

Similarly, if server-side encryption (e.g., JAR encryption) is enabled, the `provider.WithDecrypterFunc` option must also be configured for decryption support.

For operations like signature verification, only the public key material is needed, which can be retrieved directly using the JWKS function.

### Tokens

By default, ID tokens are signed using the **RS256** algorithm, so a corresponding JWK with this algorithm must be present in the server's JWKS. To modify this behavior, you can use the `provider.WithIDTokenSignatureAlgs` option to specify a default algorithm and additional signing algorithms.

Regarding access tokens, the default behavior is to issue opaque tokens. However, this can be customized by providing a function that returns `goidc.TokenOptions`.
You can create `goidc.TokenOptions` easily using:
- `goidc.NewJWTTokenOptions`
- `goidc.NewOpaqueTokenOptions`

Here is an example of how to configure the token options:
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithTokenOptions(func(_ goidc.GrantInfo, _ *goidc.Client) goidc.TokenOptions {
    // Access tokens are issued as JWTs with a lifetime of 600 seconds.
    return goidc.NewJWTTokenOptions(goidc.RS256, 600)
  }),
  ...,
)
```

In go-oidc, refresh tokens are always **opaque** and have a fixed length of 99 characters. Also, refresh and opaque access tokens are differentiated by their length. That being said, never issue opaque tokens with a length of 99 characters.

### Scopes

go-oidc provides two functions for creating scopes.

`goidc.NewScope` creates a simple scope.
```go
scope := goidc.NewScope("openid")
```

Whereas `goidc.NewDynamicScope` creates a more complex scope where validation logic goes beyond simple string matching.
```go
paymentScope := goidc.NewDynamicScope("payment", func(requestedScope string) bool {
	return strings.HasPrefix(requestedScope, "payment:")
})
// This results in true.
paymentScope.Matches("payment:30")
```
Note that this dynamic scope  will appear as "payment" under "scopes_supported" in the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint response.

The example below shows how to add the scopes to the `provider.Provider`.
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithScopes(goidc.ScopeOpenID, goidc.ScopeOfflineAccess)
  ...,
)
```

### Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)

Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) enables clients to be created and managed dynamically. This feature can be activated by adding the following option to the provider:
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithDCR(
    // Function to add custom logic during DCR.
    func(r *http.Request, id string, meta *goidc.ClientMetaInfo) error {
      return nil
    },
    // Function to validate the initial access token.
    func(r *http.Request, initialToken string) error {
      return nil
    },
  ),
  ...,
)
```

`goidc.HandleDynamicClientFunc` is executed first during requests to the DCR endpoint and also for every request to update an existing client.
By default, the DCR endpoint is `/register`, and the Dynamic Client Management (DCM) endpoint is `/register/{client_id}`.

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a security protocol that ensures both the client and server authenticate each other using TLS certificates. To enable it, configure your provider as follows:
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithMTLS(
    // mTLS host.
    "https://matls-go-oidc.com",
    // Function to fetch the client certificate.
    func(r *http.Request) (*x509.Certificate, error) {
      ...
    }
  ),
  ...,
)
```

All endpoints enabled for the provider will be listed under `mtls_endpoint_aliases` in the response of GET `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, using the provided mTLS host.
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "mtls_endpoint_aliases": {
    "...": "...",
    "token_endpoint": "https://matls-go-oidc.com/token",
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that `goidc.ClientCertFunc` may be executed multiple times during a single request to the provider. If performance is a concern, consider caching the certificate to avoid redundant computations.

### JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR)

JAR, as defined in [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html), allows clients to send authorization requests as signed and optionally encrypted JWTs (request objects) instead of URL query parameters.
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithJAR(goidc.RS256, goidc.PS256),
  ...,
)
```

This configures the supported signing algorithms, reflected in `/.well-known/openid-configuration`:
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "request_parameter_supported": true,
  "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "PS256"]
}
```

To enable JAR encryption:
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithJAR(goidc.RS256, goidc.PS256),
  provider.WithJAREncryption(goidc.RSA_OAEP_256)
  ...,
)
```

which would result in the metadata below
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "request_parameter_supported": true,
  "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "PS256"],
  "request_object_encryption_alg_values_supported": ["RSA_OAEP_256"],
  "request_object_encryption_enc_values_supported": ["A128CBC_HS256"]
}
```

To customize JAR content encryption algorithms, use `provider.WithJARContentEncryptionAlgs`.

### JWT-Secured Authorization Response Mode (JARM)

[JARM](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-jarm.html) enhances OAuth 2.0 by returning authorization responses as signed and optionally encrypted JWTs. For this, it defines new response modes: `jwt`, `query.jwt`, `fragment.jwt` and `form_post.jwt`.
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithJARM(goidc.RS256, goidc.PS256),
  ...,
)
```

By including the option `provider.WithJARM`, the well known metadata is displayed as follows
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "authorization_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "PS256"],
  "response_modes_supported": [
    "...",
    "jwt",
    "query.jwt",
    "fragment.jwt",
    "form_post.jwt",
  ]
}
```

To enable JARM encryption:
```go
op, _ := provider.New(
  ...,
  provider.WithJAM(goidc.RS256, goidc.PS256),
  provider.WithJARMEncryption(goidc.RSA_OAEP_256)
  ...,
)
```

which would result in the metadata below
```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "authorization_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "PS256"],
  "response_modes_supported": [
    "...",
    "jwt",
    "query.jwt",
    "fragment.jwt",
    "form_post.jwt",
  ],
  "authorization_encryption_alg_values_supported": ["RSA_OAEP_256"],
  "authorization_encryption_enc_values_supported": ["A128CBC_HS256"]
}
```

To customize JARM content encryption algorithms, use `provider.WithJARMContentEncryptionAlgs`.
